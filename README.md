# MAC Obfuscation in Malware Development

Welcome to the MAC Obfuscation in Malware Development repository. This project delves into techniques for obfuscating MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to evade detection and enhance the stealth of malicious network activities. MAC obfuscation is a key technique in hiding the true identity of devices involved in malicious operations.

## Overview

MAC obfuscation involves disguising or altering MAC addresses used in network communications to avoid detection and tracing. In malware development, this technique helps in:

- **Concealing Device Identity**: Hiding the true MAC address of a device to prevent tracking and identification.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Using methods such as randomization or spoofing to mask the MAC address and evade network security measures.

This repository provides resources, examples, and tools related to MAC address obfuscation.
